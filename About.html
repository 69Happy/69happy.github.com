                    <p>My name is Harry Jake B. Bahatan, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology. I hail from Ifugao, a province known for its stunning landscapes and rich cultural heritage. Growing up in a middle-class family, I've learned the value of hard work and perseverance from my parents, who have always supported my dreams. As the youngest of three siblings, I've always felt a sense of responsibility to carve out my own path. My journey into the world of IT began with a fascination for mobile games and how they're developed. This curiosity led me to choose IT as my field of study, but as I digged deeper, I discovered that it encompasses much more than just game development. From programming and cybersecurity to network administration, the world of IT is vast and dynamic, offering endless opportunities for growth and innovation. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a passion for music and sports. Playing the guitar has been a constant source of joy and self-expression for me. Over the years, I've honed my skills and developed my own unique style. Whether strumming along to my favorite songs or composing my own melodies, music has always been a cherished part of my life.

                        On sports, sepak takraw holds a special place in my heart. I discovered this traditional Southeast Asian sport during my elementary days, and I was instantly captivated by its fast-paced action and dynamic gameplay. As a player, I've learned the importance of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance on the court. Overall, my journey as an IT student has been a transformative experience, shaping not only my academic and professional aspirations but also my personal interests and hobbies. With each passing day, I'm excited to continue exploring the ever-evolving world of technology and discovering new ways to make a positive impact.
